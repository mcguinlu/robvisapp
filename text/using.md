#### __Setting up your own data__  
To ensure that this app works as expected, the uploaded risk-of-bias assessment summary table must follow a certain format.
For clarity, your data should be laid out as follows:
  * The first column contains details about the study such as author and year of publication.
  * The second and subsequent columns contain the judgements in each domain of the assessment tool. The number of columns containing domain-level assessments will vary by tool used.
  * The second last column contains the "Overall" risk-of-bias judgement.
  * The final column ("Weight") contains some measure of the result’s precision (e.g. the weight assigned to that result in a meta-analysis, or the sample size of the analysis that produced the result). If a measure of precision is not available, or to reproduce ‘equally’ weighted bar charts, these weights may all be specified to be 1.

#### __Excel example datasets/templates__                
The quickest and easiest way to correctly set up your risk-of-bias assessment summary table is to replace the example data contained in the Excel templates below with your own data, and then upload the file to the app. Alternatively, you can enter the data directly into the app by hand. Templates for the three major risk-of-bias tools supported by the app are available, in addition to a "Generic" template for use with any domain-bases assessment tool (including ROB1).
