There are several options available to customize the traffic light plot. These are described below:

* __Colour scheme:__ Choose between the standard "Cochrane" palette or the more colour-blind friendly palette.
* __Point size__: Defines the size of the "traffic lights". When you have a large number of studies, we recommend setting this to a small number.
* __Text size__: Defines the size of the text in the plot. Similar to the "point size" option, when you have a large number of studies, we recommend setting this to a small number.

Finally, when downloading the plot, you can choose between 4 formats: PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS.
