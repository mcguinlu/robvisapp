#### About the tool

`robvis` was developed during the
[Evidence Synthesis Hackathon](https://www.eshackathon.org/). This web app is built on the `robvis` R package, which can be accessed 
[here](https://www.github.com/mcguinlu/robvis). `robvis` forms part of the [metaverse](https://www.github.com/rmetaverse), a suite of tools for performing evidence synthesis in R.  

If you have questions about the tool or would like to provide feedback, please [click here](mailto:luke.mcguinness@bristol.ac.uk?cc=risk-of-bias@bristol.ac.uk) to send me an email.
