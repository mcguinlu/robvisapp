This project would not have been possible without:
  * Prof. Julian Higgins, who as my main supervisor has been extremely supportive of this project;
  * Dr. Emily Kothe, who provided help on `ggplot` coding issues;
  * Eliza Grames, who create the amazing `robvis` [hex sticker](https://github.com/mcguinlu/robvis/blob/master/man/figures/robvis_hex_box.png);
  * The Baby Driver [soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/1XaJOcLe3xMQ611SMHtOja) which kept me sane while fixing coding bugs.  


Additionally, the following people contributed valuable feedback that contributed to the development of this tool:
  * Matthew Page, Alexandra Bannach-Brown, Kyle Hamilton, Charles Gray, Vincent Cheng, Wouter van Amsterdamn, Neal Haddaway and Martin Westgate.
