There are several options available to customize the summary barplot. These are described below:

* __Use weights?__: Whether or not to create a weighted barplot. We recommend using weights when creating this figure.
* __Include overall risk of bias?__: Whether or not to include a bar for the "Overall" risk of bias column in the plot.
* __Colour scheme:__ Choose between the standard "Cochrane" palette or the more colour-blind friendly palette.

Finally, when downloading the plot, you can choose between 4 formats: PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS.
