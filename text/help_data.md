#### __Setting up your own data__
To ensure that this app works as expected, the uploaded risk-of-bias assessment summary table must follow a certain format. We recommend using Excel when creating your table - template Excel files for each tool are available for download on the "Home" tab. For clarity, your data should be laid out as follows:
  * The first column contains details about the study such as author and year of publication.
  * The second and subsequent columns contain the judgements in each domain of the assessment tool. The number of columns containing domain-level assessments will vary by tool used.
  * The second last column contains the "Overall" risk-of-bias judgement.
  * The final column ("Weight") contains some measure of the result’s precision (e.g. the weight assigned to that result in a meta-analysis, or the sample size of the analysis that produced the result). If a measure of precision is not available, or to reproduce ‘equally’ weighted bar charts as have traditionally been presented in Cochrane Reviews to date, these weights may all be specified to be 1.
  
As an example, the summary table for example assessments performed using the ROB2 is presented below:
