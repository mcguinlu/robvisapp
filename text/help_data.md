#### __Setting up your own data__
To ensure that this app works as expected, the uploaded risk-of-bias assessment summary table must follow a certain format. We recommend using Excel when creating your table - template Excel files for each tool are available for download on the "Home" tab. For clarity, your data should be laid out as follows:
  * The first column contains details about the study such as author and year of publication.
  * The second and subsequent columns contain the judgements in each domain of the assessment tool. The number of columns containing domain-level assessments will vary by tool used.
  
Two further optional columns can also be included in the uploaded data:
  
  * A column (named "Overall") risk-of-bias judgement. If you did not assess overall risk of bias, do not include this column in your uploaded dataset and uncheck the "My data contains an "Overall" column" checkbox.
  * A column (named "Weight") which contains some measure of the result’s precision (e.g. the weight assigned to that result in a meta-analysis, or the sample size of the analysis that produced the result). To reproduce ‘equally’ weighted bar charts as have traditionally been presented in Cochrane Reviews to date, the cells in this column may all be set to 1 or alternatively the "My data contains an "Weight" column" checkbox should be unchecked.
  
**Note if your data contains both an "Overall" and a "Weight" column, the order of these columns is important, in that the "Weight" column should always be the last column in the dataset.**  
  
As an example, the summary table for example assessments performed using the ROB2 is presented below:
