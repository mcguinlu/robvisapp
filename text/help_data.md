#### __Setting up your data__
To ensure that this app works as expected, the uploaded risk-of-bias assessment summary table must follow a certain format. We recommend using Excel when creating your table - template Excel files for each tool are available for download on the "Home" tab. For clarity, your data should be laid out as follows:
  * The first column contains details about the study such as author and year of publication.
  * The second and subsequent columns contain the judgements in each domain of the assessment tool. The number of columns containing domain-level assessments will vary by tool used.
  * The second last column contains the "Overall" risk-of-bias judgement.
  * The final column contains the "Weight" variable often study sample size or precision.  
  
As an example, the summary table for example assessments performed using the ROB2 is presented below:
